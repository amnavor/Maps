# Maps

Synopsis
-------------
Maps realies on machine learning to create a visualization of restaurant
ratings.  We incorporated the k-means algorithm to create data clusters 
for later grouping.  We also used simple least-squares linear regression 
to predict ratings based on factors like price.  The data comes from the
Yelp academic dataset.  Recommend.py contains machine learning algorithms, 
Utils.py includes utility functions, and data abstractions are in
abstractions.py.

This file is written in Python. This project was a group effort between 
myself and my friend Daniella Cho for the UC Berkeley CS61A course; 
therefore, staff files like tests and GUI are not included.
