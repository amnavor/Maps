# Maps

Synopsis
-------------
Maps relies on machine learning to create a visualization of restaurant
ratings.  We incorporated the k-means algorithm to create data clusters 
for later grouping.  We also used least-squares linear regression to 
predict ratings based on factors like price.  The data comes from the
Yelp academic dataset.  Recommend.py contains machine learning algorithms, 
Utils.py includes utility functions, and data abstractions are in
abstractions.py.

This file is written in Python. This project was a group effort between 
myself and my friend Daniella Cho for a UC Berkeley CS course; 
therefore, staff files like tests and GUI are not included.
